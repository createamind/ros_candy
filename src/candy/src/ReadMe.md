`beta-TCVAE` and `DIM` are defined based on `BetaVAE`, which is contained in `modules/beta_vae.py`. `Module`, which is designed to be the base class for further use, is defined in `modules/module.py`. Some come-in-handy functions are defined in `modules/utils/*`



### THE MOST IMPORTANT PART	

There's something wrong with DIM.

Also no promise for the others. If you happen to bump into one, please tell me, I'll be very grateful for that :)
